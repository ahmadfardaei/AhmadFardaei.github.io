
## About me!

<span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/pic04.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>

I have always had an insatiable appetite for practical work, so I did my bachelor's in *electrical engineering* which didn't satisfy me! <br />
Yep! It was time for a new experience; do you have any idea better than **AI**? of course not! <br />
So I moved from EE to AI in order to be more useful, as well as having more fun, and considering my passion for *sociology* and *psychology*, I guess it allows me to be more creative and deploy engineering in our daily life...

<br />
And here I am... <br />
An AI engineer with the following interests and hobbies:
